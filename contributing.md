# Read and Follow Instructions

Failure to read and delete may result in PR not being approved.

## Network vs Network Automation

The intention is to keep this Network Automation related, and not Network related. The line is blurry, and subject to change if the community so desires. If you wish to add a link that may be a bit Network leaning, but you feel it offers enough content, or has been previously denied, please open an Issue. If said Issue receives enough upvotes/attention, then it shall be included.

## Vendor Submissions

Vendor product submissions are allowed, as long as they are logical and fulfill a Network Automation need.


## Explanation

If not clear what the PR is for, please explain in further detail
